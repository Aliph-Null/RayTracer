To install libpng on Windows using vcpkg, open a command prompt and follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have vcpkg installed. If you don't have it installed, you can get it from GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to your vcpkg directory.

3. Run the following command to integrate vcpkg with Visual Studio (replace `your-visual-studio-version` with your actual version, e.g., "2019"): 

```
.\vcpkg integrate install
```

4. Now, you can install libpng using vcpkg by running the following command:

```
.\vcpkg install libpng
```

Vcpkg will handle the installation and dependencies for you. Once the installation is complete, you can use libpng in your C++ project in Visual Studio.

That's it! You've installed libpng on Windows using vcpkg.
